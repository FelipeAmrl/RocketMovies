    In 2067, humanity is facing global extinction following a global famine, and has abandoned scientific pursuits such as space exploration. The ex-NASA pilot Joseph Cooperis forced to work as a farmer. Cooper experiences a gravitational anomaly in his daughter Murph's bedroom. He deduces it to be a pattern of GPS coordinates and arrives at a secret NASA facility headed byProfessor Brand. Brand explains to Cooper that they are trying to find an exoplanet capable of supporting life, and that he is working on a gravity equation to provide a way to transport large numbers of people there. He enlists Cooper to pilot an exploratoryspacecraft, the Endurance, with a crew of three scientists: Romilly, Doyle, and Brandâ€™s daughter Amelia. This is humanity's last chance; there are no more resources to mount another expedition. A wormhole has been found near Saturn, enabling the ship to passthrough to another galaxy to search for a new home. On the other side, they investigate three planets orbiting a supermassive black hole, Gargantua, each one previously checked by a NASA scientist-explorer.
